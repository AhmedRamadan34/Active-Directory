Using PowerShell (Command Line Method)
Open PowerShell with Administrative Privileges:

Press Win + X, select Windows PowerShell (Admin).
Grant GenericAll Permission:

powershell
Copy code

# Define the variables
$aGroup = "A"
$domainAdminsGroup = "Domain Admins"

# Get the distinguished names of the groups
$aGroupObject = Get-ADGroup -Identity $aGroup
$domainAdmins = Get-ADGroup -Identity $domainAdminsGroup

# Grant GenericAll permission to the A group on the Domain Admins group
$acl = Get-ACL -Path "AD:$($domainAdmins.DistinguishedName)"
$ace = New-Object System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectoryAccessRule (
    [System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier]::new($aGroupObject.SID),
    [System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectoryRights]::GenericAll,
    [System.Security.AccessControl.AccessControlType]::Allow
)
$acl.AddAccessRule($ace)
Set-ACL -Path "AD:$($domainAdmins.DistinguishedName)" -AclObject $acl

Explanation of PowerShell Commands:
Get-ADGroup: Retrieves the Active Directory group object.

-Identity: Specifies the group by its name.
Get-ACL: Retrieves the Access Control List (ACL) for the specified AD object.

-Path: Specifies the AD object by its distinguished name.
New-Object System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectoryAccessRule: Creates a new access rule.

System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier: Constructs a security identifier for the group.
System.DirectoryServices.ActiveDirectoryRights.GenericAll: Specifies the GenericAll permission.
System.Security.AccessControl.AccessControlType.Allow: Specifies that the access rule is an allow rule.
AddAccessRule: Adds the access rule to the ACL.

Set-ACL: Applies the modified ACL to the AD object.

By following these steps, you will grant the members of the A group "GenericAll" privileges over the DOMAIN ADMINS group. This allows the A group to manipulate the DOMAIN ADMINS group as needed.
